I scrapped about 3 other attempts at making a personal site before this one; the previous ones currently in the GitHub graveyard were variations of React and SvelteKit sites. 

With this one, I wanted to use it to learn a new component system/library, [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), some basic animations using [Motion](https://motion.dev/) (formerly *Framer Motion*), and to get a little more in-depth with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Posts like this one use the [`@next/mdx`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/guides/mdx) package! The site is deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I didn't really have much of a concrete idea of how I wanted this site to turn out; at first, I thought a more picture-esque theme would be cool with some type of image background, but I shifted towards a more minimalistic theme over time. In the future, I'll probably be adding a Gallery page and some of my smaller personal projects to this site!
