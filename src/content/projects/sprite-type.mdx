Sprite Type was our project for [IrvineHacks 2025](https://irvinehacks.com/), a 3 day long hackathon. I worked on this with 3 others, and it was (most) of our first hackathons. For me, it was my first time working on a full modern web app. 

# The App

[Sprite Type](https://sprite-type.vercel.app/) is a cozy, Studio Ghibli-inspired typing test game, similar to MonkeyType. You can enter a target WPM, begin typing, and see how you perform to your target. You can also personalize your (custom-drawn!) player sprite.

A major planned feature was to “race” a second sprite that matched the inputted target WPM. Unfortunately, we were faced with technical difficulties and didn’t end up getting to complete that functionality during the hackathon, but maybe in the future it’d be fun to revisit with some free time.

The app is a simple **React/Next.js** web app (**Tailwind CSS** for styling), with a **MongoDB** backend (only used to store words, but planned to support authentication and leaderboards).
