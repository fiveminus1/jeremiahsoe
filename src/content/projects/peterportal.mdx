# About PeterPortal

PeterPortal is the premier course discovery and planning tool at UCI, built by committee members of ICSSC Projects. It allows you to search for courses and professors, see past data/reviews about them, and create four-year academic planners tailored to your major/minor.

# Background

My involvement with the project began at the start of my third year, during which I was Public Relations Chair at ICSSC. After doing some PR work highlighting the project and its members, I worked on implementing this table component to provide a better visualization of past offerings and got my [first ever PR](https://github.com/icssc/peterportal-client/pull/655) (pull request this time) merged!

Iâ€™ve worked on a [couple more PRs](https://github.com/icssc/peterportal-client/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Afiveminus1) after that, such as a review form redesign and adapting AP exam imports from a legacy planner app, and became an official team member during Spring quarter of that year.

## Tech Stack

PeterPortal is a **Next.js** (previously **Vite**) **React** web app, with the frontend using **Bootstrap** (previously) and **Material UI** components. 

The backend uses [**Anteater API**](https://github.com/icssc/anteater-api) for its data, another project by members of ICSSC. **PostgreSQL** is used to store user data, with **Drizzle** as an ORM and **tRPC** for routing.
