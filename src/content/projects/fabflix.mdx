# Background

As part of the Computer Science program at UC Irvine, you’re required to take two “projects” upper-division courses. Having already taken two other courses in the “CS 120” series, which mostly deals with information and databases, I figured **CS 122B** seemed interesting. 

>Introduces students to advanced database technologies and web applications. Topics include database connectivity (ODBC/JDBC), extending databases using stored procedures, database administration, web servers, web programming languages (Java servlets, XML, Ajax, and mobile platforms).

The course is a quarter-long project in which you build a fully functional, full-stack movie browsing web application. You can work in teams of 2, but I opted to work on the project alone (partially out of laziness to find a team and partially to learn the full content of the course). That decision killed most of the free time I had for the quarter, but in hindsight it was also the most rewarding a course’s content has been for me so far.

# About Fabflix

Fabflix allows users to explore movies by browsing via title, year, director, or starring actors. Users can also browse by genre or the starting letter of the movie.

On a movie’s individual page, it contains more info about the movie like its title, release year, director, rating, and genre. On this page, you can also add the movie to your shopping cart.

You can also see the “stars” of the movie, then go to their pages to see their name, birthyear, and other movies they’ve starred in.

When you’ve finished browsing, you can view your shopping cart and total, then proceed to “payment” where you enter in basic payment info. Upon confirming and placing your order, you’ll be taken to an order confirmation page with your total and the movies you purchased.

There’s also an “admin page” where you can manually add movies and stars to the database. 

## Development

The frontend of the app is extremely barebones, since the course tends to be more backend-focused and I assume the educational value there is to teach students basic HTML/CSS/JS (Bootstrap components are used in some areas to follow provided examples). 

The app itself is built on **Apache Tomcat**, with the course teaching how to create web servlets and API routes using Tomcat. The backend is a **MySQL** database, to which the schema was described at the beginning of the course; the movie data itself is provided in a SQL script. One of the “sub-projects” during the quarter consisted of parsing an XML file using `SAXParser` to parse large amount of movie data into the movie database.

The course also covers material like autocomplete, session persistence, pagination & sorting of results, caching, and optionally fuzzy search/custom domain registration.

As for deployment (which I found the most interesting and applicable part of the course), AWS EC2 is used to host the app. The course also teaches Docker and Kubernetes to orchestrate the deployment on the instance. Towards the end of the course, Primary-Secondary replication and load balancing (to both AWS and GCP instances) are also taught to demonstrate high-availability backend architecture.
